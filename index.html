            <h2>Hi, I'm Victor Sarca, and I love Math and Computer Science</h2>

            <p>
                I started writing math contests in grade 2, starting with the Thales contest from Mathematica Centrum.
                Since then I have achieved mostly perfect scores on easier contests and great score on more difficult
                contests, including a 6/15 on the 2023 AIME and a qualification for the 2021 CJMO.
            </p>

            <p>
                I learned to program almost 8 years ago, starting with python. Since then I have gained experience in
                many languages, from interpreted languages such as Javascript, to compiled languages such as C, and a
                few esolangs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started writing computer science contests with the Junior CCC in grade 8, which I did perfect on. In
                2023, I did both the Junior and the Senior for a total of 120 points - 75 on Junior and 45 on Senior. I
                also managed to get partials on S5 about half of an hour after the contest was over, which means if I
                didn't do Junior I would have made CCO. I've also achieved a perfect score on USACO Silver, promoting me
                to USACO Gold.
            </p>

            <p>
                My favourite activities are playing tennis, videogames, and grinding math and competitive programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                My favourite programming language is C. I dislike Java and Object Oriented Programming in general. Java
                has too many overcomplicated features which aren't necessary, yet the language does not allow the user
                to manipulate pointers. A programming language shouldn't be as complicated as Java; if people have
                problems understanding the language then that means it isn't very good. I like C because it is simple
                yet robust, and integrates so well with the inner workings of all operating systems. Unlike Java, C can
                actually open files on my device and will never tell me that my Documents folder is empty and that my
                file doesn't exist. Java does that every single time.
            </p>

            <p>
                My favourite data structure is the heap, specifically the binary heap. A heap is used to find the
                smallest/largest element in some data. A simple implementation of mine provides a method for adding an
                element, and a method for removing the smallest element from a heap. Although binary heaps are the worst
                type of heap, they are the simplest to understand and to implement, and after reading about other types
                of heaps I decided they weren't worth the effort to learn. Other heap types offer only slight
                improvements in exchange for a ridiculously complicated algorithm; no thank you. A binary heap stores
                all elements in a binary tree, which may simply be the first N elements of an array. Every node in the
                tree is guaranteed to be smaller than the nodes below it, thus making the topmost node the smallest. To
                remove this node, however, another node must fill the small it leaves behind. Usually that last element
                of the array is moved to the top of the heap and then sorted down the heap to its correct position. When
                adding an element to the heap, it is appended to the end of the array, and then sorted up the tree.
                Since the height of the tree is log(N), both methods have a time complexity of log(N).

                My favorite animal is the groundhog. I took this picture in Quebec during the summer break of 2021.

                Finally, my favorite game is called Stephen's Sausage Roll. It's a very difficult puzzle that was made
                in 2016, about cooking sausages on a grill in a tight space. I stopped playing it when school started,
                but I hope to finish the game this summer.

            <h1>Unit 1</h1>

            <h2>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>

            <p>
                Java is an object oriented language, which means that all running code is part of an object.
                Written code forms classes which can be instantiated to create objects. The class of an object defines
                its methods and variables.
            </p>

            <p>
                A Java class declares and defines the variables and methods pertaining to it. A class may either be used
                statically (as explained below) or used to create an object using the <code>new</code> keyword. All
                variables and methods must pertain to a class; no code should be written
                outside the coundary of the class.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Every object has an identity, state, and behaviour.
            <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
                <li>The object's physical address in memory defines its identity.</li>
                <li>The variables of an object define its state.</li>
                <li>The methods of an object define its behaviour.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <img src="./images/oop.jpg" alt="OOP diagram" style="width:80%;">

            <h2>Encapsulation</h2>

            <p>
                In order to prevent maluse of an object, Java classes can restrict access to methods and variables
                inside
                them.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> There are three levels of access:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
                <li><code>public</code> - can be accessed by anything</li>
                <li><code>private</code> - can only be accessed by the object itself</li>
                <li><code>protected</code> - can be accessed by subclasses of the object, and the object itself (see
                    Unit 2)</li>
            </ul>
            <em>
                Note: the public and private modifiers can also be applied to the classes themselves; the modified class
                behaves the same relative to its file as a variable with the same modifier would in an object.
            </em>
            </p>

            <p> Common Java practice guards variables from misuse with encapsulation. Encapsulated variables should
                always be private. In order to access them, public get and set methods are
                created, with all necessary safeguards to ensure proper use of the class. </p>

            <p>
                Here is an example Java class with an encapsulated variable:
            <pre>public class MyClass
{
    private int myNumber;

    public MyClass(int num)
    {
        myNumber = num;
    }

    public int getNumber()
    {
        return myNumber;
    }

    public void setNumber(int num)
    {
        myNumber = num;
    }
}</pre>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                In <code>MyClass</code>, the integer variable <code>myNumber</code> is declared private, and as such is
                not visible outside the object. The value of <code>myNumber</code> can only be read or replaced using
                the public methods in the class. <br>
                There are two types of these methods:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
                <li>Accessor methods - read the value of a variable - <code>getNumber()</code> </li>
                <li>Mutator methods - change the value of a variable - <code>setNumber()</code> </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Unit 2</h1>

            <h2>Inheritance</h2>

            <p> Inheritance is a feature of Java that allows code to be reused. A Java class can inherit the methods and
                variables of up to one other class, and any number of interface classes. This means that the class will
                have all the methods and variables of the class it extends, called the parent/superclass, and can use
                those methods. However, private members of the parent class will remain inaccessible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is an example of a class extension in Java:
            <pre>public class Bungalow
{
    private int floorArea;

    public Bungalow(int area)
    {
        floorArea = area;
    }

    public int getArea()
    {
        return floorArea; // Line A
    }
}

public class House extends Bungalow
{
    private int numFloors;

    public House(int area, int floors)
    {
        super(area); // See Polymorphism below
        numFloors = floors;
    }

    public int getFloors()
    {
        return numFloors;
    }
}</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>House</code> class extends <code>Bungalow</code>, which means that a House object will have an
                integer
                <code>floorArea</code> and a method <code>getArea()</code> to access it. Since <code>floorArea</code>
                was declared private in Bungalow, a House object cannot directly access that variable. However, the
                public method <code>getArea()</code> can be accessed by both the House class and externally since it is
                declared public.
            </p>

            <img src="./images/inheritance.jpg" alt="Inheritance diagram" style="width:80%;">

            <h1>Unit 8</h1>

            <h2>Polymorphism</h2>

            <p>
                In Java, a subclass may override a method from the parent class, completely replacing the code of the
                parent class method. This is achieved by declaring a method with the same name, parameters and return
                value as the superclass's method. When the method is called in an object of the subclass, the new code
                will run.
            </p>

            <p>
                When overriding a method or defining a constructor, the previous definition of the method can be
                accessed from the superclass using the <code>super</code> keyword. A call to super is optional in all
                but the constructor, which will default to <code>super()</code> if no super call is explicitly defined.
                Super methods must be called before other code runs.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Super methods work as follows:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
                <li>A call to <code>super</code> at the start of a constructor with appropriate arguments will run the
                    code from the matching constructor in the superclass</li>
                <li>A call to <code>super.<em>method_name</em>()</code> at the start of a method will call the matching
                    method in the superclass </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, a BetterBungalow class could be declared as such:
            <pre>public class BetterBungalow extends Bungalow
{
    private int basementArea;

    public Bungalow(int area, int basement)
    {
        super(area);
        basementArea = basement;
    }

    public int getArea()
    {
        return super.getArea() + basementArea;
    }
}</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>getArea()</code> method in <code>BetterBungalow</code> overrides the method with the same name
                in the <code>Bungalow</code> class. A call to <code>super.getArea()</code> will run the Line A in the
                Bungalow class, which will return the value of <code>floorArea</code>. The value is then added to the
                <code>basementArea</code> to calculate the total area of the home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: Similarly to <code>super()</code>, constructors may also call <code>this()</code> to run another
                constructor in the same class.
            </p>

            <img src="./images/polymorphism.jpg" alt="Polymorphism diagram" style="width:80%;">

            <h2>Interfaces</h2>

            <p>
                There are two types of classes that cannot be instantiated, but are instead used as superclasses.
            </p>

            <p>
                A Java <code>interface</code> is a class with very little code. It may only contain
                <code>static final</code>
                variables and method declarations. It contains no constructors or instance variables, and only static
                methods can be defined. An interface is a template for a class, providing a guideline for its
                implementation. Although a class can only extend one other class, it can implement as many interfaces as
                needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                An <code>abstract</code> class is a partially defined class. Methods in classes that are declared
                without
                implementation must be defined as abstract. If a class contains any abstract methods the class must also
                be abstract.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is an example of an interface and an abstract class:
            <pre>public interface Combinable
{
    public Combinable add(Combinable other);
    public Combinable subtract(Combinable other);
}

public abstract class Box
{
    private int bottomArea, boxDepth; // Measured in cm^2 and cm respectively

    public Box(int area, int depth)
    {
        bottomArea = area;
        boxDepth = depth;
    }

    public int getArea()
    {
        return bottomArea;
    }

    public int getDepth()
    {
        return boxDepth;
    }

    public abstract int getVolume(); // Box class does not implement this method
}

public class Sandbox extends Box implements Combinable
{
    private int sandVolume; // Amount in cm^3

    public Sandbox(int area, int depth, int sand)
    {
        super(area, depth);
        sandVolume = sand;
    }

    public int getSand()
    {
        return sandVolume;
    }

    /** Returns the space left in the sandbox in cm^3 */
    public int getVolume()
    {
        return getArea()*getDepth() - sandVolume;
    }

    public Combinable add(Combinable other)
    {
        if (!(other instanceof Sandbox))
            return new Sandbox(getArea(), getDepth(), sandVolume);
        return new Sandbox(getArea(), getDepth(), sandVolume + other.getSand());
    }

    public Combinable subtract(Combinable other)
    {
        if (!(other instanceof Sandbox) || sandVolume < ((Sandbox)other).getSand())
            return new Sandbox(getArea(), getDepth(), sandVolume);
        return new Sandbox(getArea(), getDepth(), sandVolume - ((Sandbox)other).getSand());
    }
}</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>Combinable</code> interface defines the methods <code>add</code> and <code>subtract</code>,
                which have another Combinable as an argument and return a Combinable. These methods are not implemented
                in the interface, but rather the implementation is left for the subclass. The abstract class
                <code>Box</code> provides functionality for the area and depth of the box, but does not implement the
                volume method, since the box does not know what it will contain. The <code>Sandbox</code> class extends
                <code>Box</code> and implements a <code>Combinable</code> class, inheriting the functionality of both.
                It then has to implement the abstract methods for adding, subtracting, and calculating the volume of a
                Sandbox.
            </p>

            <h2>Downcasting</h2>

            <p>
                In Java, an object may be stored in a variable of its type, or in a vairable of a parent type. In the
                <code>Sandbox</code> class, when implementing the <code>add</code> and <code>subtract</code> methods the
                arguments are <code>Combinable</code> variables. However, since the Sandbox class implements a
                Combinable a Sandbox can be passed as an argument to the function.
            </p>

            <p>
                When an object is stored in a different variable type, it is called upcasting. The object remains
                unchanged, but is treated by Java as an object of the variable type. For example, if a
                <code>Sandbox</code> object were stored in a variable of <code>Combinable</code> type, then the method
                <code>getSand()</code> could not be accessed, since Combinables do not have a method by that name. In
                order to access Snadbox methods, the object must be casted back to a Snadbox object.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that casting will only work with a type that the object has inherited. Casting a
                <code>Combinable</code> to a <code>Sandbox</code> is not possible because a Combinable does not have the
                same methods and variables as a Sandbox.
            </p>

            <h2>Arrays</h2>

            <p>
                If multiple instances of an object or data type exist with some correlation to each other, they may be
                stored in an array. An array of a data type can hold multiple instances of it, to be accessed and stored
                more easily. This is how to declare, initialize, and access an array of 20 <code>int</code> variables.
            <pre>int[] myArr;
// int myArr[];                     // Also valid
// myArr = new int[];               // No elements
// myArr = new int[20];             // 20 elements, not set
// myArr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};         // 5 set elements
myArr = new int[20]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // 20 elements, the first 5 are set
System.out.println(myArr[2]);</pre>
            This declares, creates, and initializes an array <code>myArr</code>. Notice how the <code>[]</code> can be
            placed before or after the array name with the same effect. The array can be initialized in a number of
            ways, specifying the size and/or contents of the array. Finally, <code>myArr[x]</code> will access the xth
            element of the array. Note that the first element of an array is always element 0; <code>myArr[0]</code> =
            1.
            </p>

            <h1>Unit 4</h1>

            <h2>Arraylists</h2>

            <p>
                An <code>Arraylist</code> in Java is a type of list that behaves very similar to an array. It allows all
                normal array functionality, while having variable length. It hold hold objects of a specified type in a
                certain order. See below for an example of how an <code>Arraylist</code> can be used.
            </p>

            <pre>Arraylist&ltString&gt names = new Arraylist&ltString&gt();
Arraylist&ltInteger&gt numbers = new Arraylist&lt&gt(); // Compiler infers type from variable declaration
names.add("John");
names.add(0, "Mary");
System.out.println(names.size()); // 2
System.out.println(names.get(0)); // Mary
System.out.println(names.remove(1)); // John
System.out.println(names.size()); // 1</pre>

            <p>
                The <code>Arraylist</code>'s type is specified inside a pair of <code>&lt&gt</code>. Note that the
                compiler will infer the type of the Arraylist from the variable type, so when creating
                <code>numbers</code>, the type of Arraylist is not specified and still compiles without error. The
                example also demonstrates the methods of an Arraylist; adding, inserting, getting, and removing an
                element, as well as getting the size (number of elements) in the Arraylist.

            <h2>Sorting</h2>

            <p>
                Sorting is the process of putting all the elements of an array in order. There are many algorithms to do
                this, but only the most common are listed here.
            </p>

            <h3>Bubble sort</h3>

            <p>
                Bubble sort loops through an array, swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This
                process repeats until the array is sorted, which is when no further swaps can be made. Every swap
                changes the order of exactly one pair of items, from an incorrect state to a correct state; this makes
                the array closer to being sorted after every swap. If the array is not sorted, there is always at least
                one possible swap, which guarantees that the array will be sorted when the algorithm is finished. Below
                is an implementation of Bubble sort on integers.
            </p>

            <pre>void bsort(int[] arr)
{
    boolean didSomething = true;

    while (didSomething) // While a swap was made
    {
        for (int i=1; i&ltarr.length; i++) // For every pair of elements at indices i and i-1
        {
            if (arr[i] &gt arr[i-1]) // Check order of elements
            {
                // Swap elements
                arr[i] ^= arr[i-1]; arr[i-1] ^= arr[i]; arr[i] ^= arr[i-1];
            }
        }
    }
    // Array is sorted here because no further swaps were made
}</pre>

            <img src="./images/bubblesort.gif" alt="Bubble sort demonstration" style="width:50%;">

            <h3>Mergesort</h3>

            <p>
                Mergesort sorts an array using the merge operation, which takes two sorted arrays and merges their
                contents to become a larger sorted array. By merging every pair of elements in an array, following by
                every pair of pairs, and so on, every element will be merged into one final sorted array. Note that an
                individual element is a sorted array of one. Below is an implementation of recursive Mergesort.
            </p>

            <pre>void msort(int[] arr) // For user
{
    msort(arr, 0, arr.length); // Sort the array from start to finish
}

// Sorts the elements in interval [left,right)
void msort(int[] arr, int left, int right)
{
    // Exit condition
    if (left + 1 == right) return; // Sorting sequence of length 1, exit

    // Sort halves
    int middle = (left+right)/2;
    msort(arr, left, middle, temp); // Sort lower half
    msort(arr, middle, right, temp); // Sort upper half

    // Merge operation
    int[] temp = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, left, middle);
    int lindex=0, rindex=middle, index=left;
    while (lindex &lt temp.length && rindex &lt right) // While there are still elements to merge
    {
        if (arr[rindex] &lt temp[lindex]) // Right element is smaller, insert that one
            arr[index++] = arr[rindex++];
        else                              // Left element is smaller or equal, insert that one
            arr[index++] = temp[lindex++];
    }
    for (; lindex &lt temp.length; lindex++) // Add all remaining elements in left array
    {
        arr[index++] = temp[lindex];
    }
    for (; rindex &lt right; rindex++) // Add all remaining elements in right array
    {
        arr[index++] = arr[rindex];
    }
    // Interval [left,right) is now sorted
}</pre>

            <img src="./images/mergesort.gif" alt="Mergesort demonstration" style="width:50%;">

            <h3>Quicksort</h3>

            <p>
                Quicksort sorts an array by dividing the array into smaller arrays and then fusing them together again,
                just like Mergesort. However, quicksort does not merge the elements back together, instead sorting them
                when breaking up the array.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a given array, quicksort will pick a random element as a pivot. It will then divide the array into
                two; one array for elements less than or equal to the pivot, and another for elements greater than the
                pivot. It amy also keep track of how many elements are equal to the pivot. After sorting both arrays,
                they are assembled back together in order; first the array of elements less than the pivot, followed by
                all elements greater than the pivot. Once quicksort has broken an array into individual items, the array
                is guaranteed to be assembled back together in sorted order. Below is an implementation of a version of
                quicksort called left-right pointers, which divides the array in-place, without extra storage like
                mergesort.
            </p>

            <pre>void qsort(int arr[]) // For user
{
    qsort(arr, 0, arr.length); // Sort the array from start to finish
}

// Sorts the elements in interval [left,right)
void qsort(int[] arr, int left, int right)
{
    // Exit condition
    if (left + 1 == right) return; // Sorting sequence of length 1, exit

    // Setup
    int pivot = arr[left + (int)(Math.random()*(right-left))]; // Pick random element for pivot
    int equals = 0; // The number of items equal to pivot
    int lpoint=left, rpoint = right-1; // Left and right pointers for array looping

    // Split array into less than pivot and greater than pivot
    while (lpoint &lt rpoint)
    {
        // Swap the two elements at lpoint and rpoint, first counting if one is equal to pivot
        if (arr[rpoint] == pivot) equals++;
        arr[lpoint] ^= arr[rpoint]; arr[rpoint] ^= arr[lpoint]; arr[lpoint] ^= arr[rpoint];

        // Find the next pair to swap
        while (lpoint &lt rpoint && arr[lpoint] &lt= pivot) lpoint++; // Find the next element to be switch in the left array
        while (lpoint &lt rpoint && arr[rpoint] &gt pivot) rpoint--;  // Find the next element to be switch in the right array
    }
    if (arr[lpoint] &lt= pivot) lpoint++; // lpoint is now the first item in rpoint

    // Sort the subarrays
    qsort(arr, left, lpoint-equals);
    qsort(arr, lpoint, right);
    // Interval [left,right) is now sorted
}</pre>

            <h2>Searching Algorithms</h2>

            <p>
                To find an element in an array, a searching algorithm is used. It will determine whether an element can
                be found in an array, and where it is. The two most common search algorithms are listed here.
            </p>

            <h3>Sequential search</h3>

            <p>
                Sequential search operates on any array, that does not have to be sorted. It will check every element of
                the array until it finds one that matches, or reaches the end of the array. Below is an implementation
                of sequential search.
            </p>

            <pre>int ssearch(int[] arr, int item)
{
    for (int i=0; i&ltarr.length; i++)
    {
        if (arr[i] == item) return i; // Index of first occurence of item
    }
    return -1; // -1 if not found
}</pre>

            <img src="./images/sequentialsearch.gif" alt="Sequential search demonstration" style="width:50%;">

            <h3>Binary search</h3>

            <p>
                Binary search operates on a sorted array. It will begin by checking the middle of the array; if the
                element there is too large, it knows the search item is in the lower half of the array, and if the
                element in the middle is too small, then it knwos the search item is in the upper half. Binary search
                will iterate on the array until the middle element is the element desired, or it has found the location
                where the search item should be inserted. Below is an example of iterative binary search.
            </p>

            <pre>int bsearch(int[] arr, int item)
{
    int left = 0, middle, right=arr.length;
    while (left &lt right)
    {
        middle = (left+right)/2;
        if (item == arr[middle]) return middle;
        if (item &lt arr[middle]) right = middle; // item is lower than middle
        else left = middle+1; // item is above middle
    }
    if (arr[left] == item) return left; // Found element
    return -1-left; // Element not found
}</pre>

            <h2>Recursion</h2>

            <p>
                Recursion is when a method calls itself in a loop to complete a task. Recursive algorithms are usually
                easier to write than iterative loops, but are harder to debug and are slower than their counterparts.
                Check <a href="#unit-5">the Sorting and Searching tutorial</a> for some examples of recursive functions.
            </p>

            <p>
                A recursive algorithm should always finish at some point; that is, there must be an input for which the
                code does not make any subsequent calls, and the function must be guaranteed to converge to that input.
                Recursive algorithms also have the downside of a recursion limit, which is a Java specific problem.
                There is a hard limit on the depth of recursion in Java, which can be found with the recursive method
                below. In other languages, such as C, there is no limit so the function can recurse until there is no
                more memory.
            </p>

            <pre>int count=0;
                
void getRecursionLimit() throws StackOverflowError
{
    count++;
    recursionLimit();
}

void printRecursionLimit()
{
    count = 0;
    try
    {
        getRecursionLimit();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        System.out.println("Recursion limit: " + count);
    }
}</pre>

            <img src="./images/recursion.jpg" alt="Recursive tree" style="width:50%;">

            <p>
                A call to <code>printRecursionLimit</code> will output the maximum recursion depth of Java.
            </p>

            <h2>Extra: Converting to an Iterative Method</h2>

            <p>
                All recursive methods can be converted to an iterative method, thus eliminating the overhead cost of the
                method calls. However, this is not recommended because the resulting code will be much mroe complicated.
                An iterative version of the recursive method will store all the variables of the recursive method in a
                stack. When a call is made, the new parameters are added to the stack. When a method returns, the top of
                the stack is removed. Thus, the top of the stack always contains the data relating to the current
                running iteration, and all previoud function calls have their data stored beneath that. Finally,
                similarly to the way the computer manages function calls, if the method requires computation before and
                after recursing, a variable can be added to the method to track what part of the function was executing
                when the function call was made.
            </p>

            <p>
                In summary, a recursive method can be made iterative by simulating the stack and callbacks yourself;
                this increases the performance of an algorithm significantly. This is most easily done for recursive
                functions with no return value, since implementing a return system is annoying, or for recursive
                functions that only have one recursive call, which makes organisation much easier.

            <h1>Past Projects</h1>

            <h2>2015</h2>

            <h3>First Project</h3>

            <p>
                My first ever programming project was in 2015, when I first learned Scratch and Python. I noticed that
                my Raspberry Pi had some games on it written in Python, and managed to find the source code in the
                files. Since I didn't understand what programming was (who could blame a grade 3 for that), all I did
                was copy and paste all the snake code to make another one. After fixing an enormous amount of errors, I
                could control a green worm with the arrows keys and a blue worm of my own creation with WASD. The worms
                of course couldn't collide, but it was still a lot of fun to play with friends. And of course, after 8
                years, I have no idea where the file is (not on my computer for sure). So if you happen to find a file
                named "WORMY 2P.py", please let me know.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since 2015, I have countless unfinished projects in python, and then C, which are not worth showing
                here. Until 2021, I have nothing to show.
            </p>

            <h2>2021</h2>

            <h3>ICS2</h3>

            <p>
                I took my first ICS course in grade 9, with a perfect score on CCC Junior already under my belt. For my
                ICS2 final project, I was tasked to create an interactive storybook in Processing 3. I chose to make my
                slideshow about electricity. Below are some screenshots of the application, which contains a whopping
                3709 non-empty lines of code! Click <a href="./downloads/storybook.zip" download>here</a> to download
                the storybook, if you want to explore it further.
            </p>

            <h2>2022</h2>

            <h3>ICS3</h3>

            <p>
                One year after ICS2 is ICS3. For my final project, I had to create a web application with some academic
                purpose. I chose to make a learning tool for artificial intelligence, which would provide some simple
                and well documented code for creating and training a neural network. Since we only had a few weeks, the
                final product is very finnicky, but works. I decided to train the network on the MNIST database of
                handwritten digits, and after a few minutes it can achieve over 99% accuracy.
            </p>

            <p>
                For this project I worked in a group. The UI was created by Felix Zhao and Lukas Li, and the artificial
                intelligence was written by me. The AI was written without any external libraries other than gpu.js for
                hardware acceleration. The files provided below remain unchanged since the time of submission. The
                testing.html file has a lot fo testing code, but I consider it easier to use than the GUI.
            </p>

            <p>LearnAI.js can be downloaded <a href="./downloads/LearnAI.js" download>here</a>.
                The <a href="./downloads/testing.html" download>testing page</a> will take a while to load because it
                will need to load <a
                    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VN4vY0bXLMe98zwKYd3ZtcOwhotBWWdY/view?usp=sharing"
                    download>the MNIST database</a> in the largest
                size that browsers can handle. The AI can be controlled through console commands, although it will begin
                training by itself. There is also an ability to upload an existing file, which will allow you to load
                <a href="./downloads/network.txt" download>the neural network</a> I trained in a few hours. For more
                information,
                you can read LearnAI.js, or call <code>NeuralNetwork.print()</code> and <code>DeepLearner.print()</code>
                to output the full documentation in the console. The testing.html file also contains the method
                <code>testOnTrainingData</code>, which is useful for evaluating the network.
            </p>

            <h3>Ants and Turmites</h3>

            <p>
                I have many small projects from the past few years. I have chosen this project in particular to show
                here because it looks cool. Note that since this is a GUI project with many dependencies, it will be
                very difficult to run the source code. Also, I have to change the physical code in order to change the
                ant/turmite, so the executable is pretty useless. You can only view a singular type of ant!
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal of this project was to simulate
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant">Langton's ant</a>, and the complicated
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite">turmites</a>. The program can simulate any ant or
                termite specified. Below are examples of the original Langton's ant, and of my favorite
                variation: it looks amazing, and is the second-simplest type of turmite; only 2 colors and 2 states.
            </p>

            <h1>Recent Ideas</h1>

            <p>
                Currently I am exploring noise generation and the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. These are small
                projects which won't have anything to show, but will be useful to learn. I am also thinking of applying
                noise generation to terrain generation, to try to get some real-looking terrain and maybe another
                project to work on.
            </p>

            <p>
                The algorithms I have recently learned about are Perlin, Simplex, and Worley noise, and Wave Function
                Collapse. I am also implementing a set and multiset and similar structures for competitive programming.
            </p>

            <h1>Current Work / Ideas</h1>

            <p>
                Although I have yet to implement Wave Function Collapse, I have been successful in my attempts to
                generate noise, and have even created an unfinished demo game using noise for terrain generation. The
                game is not availabel for download, because it only compiles for my computer; on other computers it has
                problems with dlls. Furthermore, the source code is of no use because the project depends on <a
                    href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDL2</a>, a lightweight
                low-level cross-platform graphics interface.
            </p>

            <h3>ICS4</h3>

            <p>
                After ICS3 is ICS4. For my final project, I created a game together with 2 colleagues. As the project
                leader, I was responsible for assigning tasks and coordinating my group members, as well as writing the
                majority of the code. Writing a game in Java was a difficult task, as the default Java windowing tookit
                is very unsuitable for creating a game, and my object-oriented programming approach turned out to be
                very time-consuming. Our final project has lessons, puzzles, combat, sound, and more. Overall, I'm happy
                with how I finished highschool computer science. Next: university!
            </p>
